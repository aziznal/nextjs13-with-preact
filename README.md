# Nextjs 13 with Preact (non-working example)

This was my attempt at trying out preact with nextjs to make use of things like preact signals.

The steps I took to set this up were the following:

- I read [this article](https://dev.to/dephraiim/use-preact-in-nextjs-13-24pp)

Unfortunately, it seems like there's a version mismatch between preact and react 18 which
is causing the whole thing to not work, so this example is useless.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
